# Sky: COTL Automatic Music Player for PC

Automatically play music in the game Sky: Children of the Light (*referred to as Sky*) from pre-written music sheets and mimicing key strokes. This project is made for fun, I enjoy music and Sky, using this goes against terms of service of Sky so use it at your own risk. I will not take any responsibility for anyone getting banned from using this. 

## About

This python script takes the JSON file or skysheet file found in the [Sky Music Nightly](https://specy.github.io/skyMusic/) website and playes the song in game.
The script will give you a 3 second window after you have selected a song to tab back into the game before it tabs back for you, sometimes this bugs out so I do recommend doing it manually, it will pause the song if you tab out of Sky so it does not take over your keyboard.
